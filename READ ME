thi is a simple demo/exercice project for mui the ebst ui framework for react app so in the app the add button may seem weird 
but it's just that i couldn't manage with the default spacing provided by material ui and moreover my screen is not big enough
otherwise it would normally be placed lower. Feel free to revise the positin as you want
